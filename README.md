# Airdancer Server

A Node.js web server running on my Raspberry Pi.

The bare bones landing page built by v0.1.0 is at [krisairdancer.com][https://krisairdancer.com/]. There is also a copy of the [Vidya Intarweb Playlist HTML5 Player](https://github.com/fpgaminer/vip-html5-player) running on the server.

This version v1.0.0 is a WIP and will ultimately replace v0.1.0.

## Component Versions

- **airdancer-frontend**: v1.0.0 (pre-release)
- **vidya-clone**: v0.1.0 (pre-release)
