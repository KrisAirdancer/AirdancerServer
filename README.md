# Airdancer Service

A Node.js web server running on my Raspberry Pi.

The bare bones landing page built by [v0.1.0](https://github.com/KrisAirdancer/krisairdancer-dot-com/releases/tag/v0.1.0) is at [krisairdancer.com](https://krisairdancer.com/). There is also a copy of the [Vidya Intarweb Playlist HTML5 Player](https://github.com/fpgaminer/vip-html5-player) running on the server.

This project is a WIP and is incomplete in its current form. See [v0.1.0](https://github.com/KrisAirdancer/krisairdancer-dot-com/releases/tag/v0.1.0) for the most recent functional version.
