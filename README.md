# Airdancer Service

A Node.js web server running on my Raspberry Pi.

The bare bones landing page built by v0.1.0 is at [krisairdancer.com](https://krisairdancer.com/). There is also a copy of the [Vidya Intarweb Playlist HTML5 Player](https://github.com/fpgaminer/vip-html5-player) running on the server.

This version v1.0.0 is a WIP and will ultimately replace v0.1.0.
