# Airdancer Service

A Node.js web server running on my Raspberry Pi.

The bare bones landing page is at [krisairdancer.com](https://krisairdancer.com/). There is also a copy of the [Vidya Intarweb Playlist HTML5 Player](https://github.com/fpgaminer/vip-html5-player) running on the server.

I am rebuilding this server from the ground up:

- The new server (airdancer-frontend) is being built [here](https://github.com/KrisAirdancer/airdancer-server/tree/api-redesign-2022/airdancer-frontend).
- My clone of the Vidya Intarweb Playlist will be included and is being build [here](https://github.com/KrisAirdancer/airdancer-server/tree/api-redesign-2022/vidya-clone).
