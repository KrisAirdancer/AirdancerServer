A Node.js server running on my Raspberry Pi.

This server currently builds a simple music player website build from the [Vidya Intarweb Playlist HTML5 Player](https://github.com/fpgaminer/vip-html5-player). Essentially a clone of [Vipvgm.net](https://www.vipvgm.net/).

This server has not yet been opened up to run outside my local network.
