I'm still working those out!\r\n\r\nMy intent for this part of the site is to be able to blog from Europe while Vista and I hike <a href=\"http://www.johnhayeswalks.com/2014/09/munich-to-venice-dream-way-review.html\">Der Traumpfad</a>. But I'm still a bit skeptical that this will work. Guess we'll just have to see how it goes.\r\n\r\nOh! I should also mention, there won't be any images in the posts on this blog yet. I haven't had the time to get that part setup yet. But I'll hopefully have that ready by the time we leave for the trip.\r\n\r\n- Chris"
