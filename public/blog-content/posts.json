And just in time too!\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"350px\" src=\"https://krisairdancer.com/blog-content/images/marmolada_sella_ronda_grb.jpg\">\r\n<span class=\"caption\">Us at The Marmolada, Italy. (2019)</span>\r\n\r\nSpeaking of just in time. We'll be visiting The Marmolada - mountain in the background - again while hiking Der Traumpfad. In fact, we'll be hiking down to the lake, Lago di Fedaia, in this picture. It's been a minute since we visited to ride <a href=\"https://goldenramenbowl.com/sella-ronda-2019/\">The Sella Ronda</a> and do some Via Ferratas in 2019, so it'll be exciting to go back.\r\n\r\n- Chris"

I'm still working those out!\n\nMy intent for this part of the site is to be able to blog from Europe while Vista and I hike <a href=\"http://www.johnhayeswalks.com/2014/09/munich-to-venice-dream-way-review.html\">Der Traumpfad</a>. But I'm still a bit skeptical that this will work. Guess we'll just have to see how it goes.\n\nOh! I should also mention, there won't be any images in the posts on this blog yet. I haven't had the time to get that part setup yet. But I'll hopefully have that ready by the time we leave for the trip.\n\n- Chris"
