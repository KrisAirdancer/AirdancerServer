It seems to be much more intense in Wyoming and Nebraska than anywhere we've driven before. To add to the misery, Vista discovered that the hotel coffee she had gotten tasted like sugar water instead of coffee and we started looking for a place to stop for a replacement. A hundred miles outside of Cheyanne, we discovered a Starbucks and Vista's coffee was restored.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, I managed to write out the Day 1 blog post on my phone, which proved to be much easier than I thought. It would appear that I've finally managed to build something that works well and is usable.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the drive, it was uneventful. The stretch of Nebraska we drove through contained nothing but corn fields and small towns. So without further adue, an obligatory corn field photo.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"350px\" src=\"https://krisairdancer.com/blog-content/images/detroit-move-2023-corn-1.jpg\">\r\n<span class=\"caption\">Nebraskan corn fields - \"they have the juices\"</span>\r\n\r\nToday's stretch was the longest one of the trip and we didn't arrive in Omaha until around 3PM. This gave me about an hour to work on graphics before dinner.\r\n\r\nDinner ended up being a meal from the hotel restaurant. It wasn't bad, but greasy fried chicken fingers and a chicken burger weren't exactly what we were hoping for. But considering the low amoung of effort we had to put forth to find a place to eat, we can't complain too much.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, more UK trip planning and an early bed - we'll likely be feeling the time change in the morning.\r\n\r\nTomorrow: Chicago."},{"id":"ucqv5mahyg-wjl319vt5n-chbu84yx58","date":"October 9, 2023","title":"Day 1: SLC to Cheyenne","author":"Chris","content":"Today begins the first of two cross country drives to move us to Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\nWe started our day with a drive through the autumn leaves of the Wasatch range before plunging into the flatlands of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nOn our way through Park city, we were treated to a \"fog lake.\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"350px\" src=\"https://krisairdancer.com/blog-content/images/detroit-move-2023-fog.jpg\">\r\n<span class=\"caption\">A \"fog lake\" just outside of Park City.</span>\r\n\r\nAfter this, there was basically nothing of interest to report and fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, we got to Cheyanne by about 1PM.\r\n\r\nThe way the lodging is distributed means that we were forced to do the trip in either two really long days (arrive at each stop around midnight) or into four half days.\r\n\r\nWe chose the four half days so we could avoid driving tired on the second days. Something that seemed a bit foolish considering the length of the drive.\r\n\r\nIn Cheyanne, we found a place to grab lunch - Taco John's - and then checked into the hotel.\r\n\r\nArriving early did provide me with the benefit of being able to get started on my graphics assignment, which with any luck, will be done by the end of Fall Break (a week from Monday).\r\n\r\nAfter working for an hour or so, we went looking for something other than the down home hearty food that dominates the quisine in Wyoming and managed to find a pretty good ramen shop in the dying Cheyanne mall.\r\n\r\nAfter this, we did a bit of planning for the next adventure - the UK - and turned in for the night.\r\n\r\nTomorrow: Omaha."},{"id":"s9utj8mp53-i70d6xpm01-8xojuwo73f","date":"August 22, 2023","title":"Knee Trouble","author":"Chris","content":"Well, we should be on a flight to Munich right now, but I managed to twist my knee up pretty bad last week and it hasn't made enough of a recovery to warrant walking 350 miles through the Alps.\r\n\r\nThus, we will not be hiking Der Traumpfad this year.\r\n\r\nThat's okay, there's always next year. And considering the condition of my knee, it's likely better to do a smaller trip as a test run after I finish my PT. To this end, we're looking into the Tour du Mont Blanc. The TMB still has some solid ascents and descents, but is one third (110 miles) of Der Traumpfad. So it should be a good introduction to trekking in the Alps.\r\n\r\n- Chris"},{"id":"6ia96kemmb-0mt8p169wk-kvnfztkugb","date":"July 29, 2023","title":"Blog Upgrade: Image Support","author":"Chris","content":"The blog now has support for images to be embedded in posts.

In fact, we'll be hiking down to the lake, Lago di Fedaia, in this picture. It's been a minute since we visited to ride <a href=\"https://goldenramenbowl.com/sella-ronda-2019/\">The Sella Ronda</a> and do some Via Ferratas in 2019, so it'll be exciting to go back.\r\n\r\n- Chris"},{"id":"k4nqss0oi6-b5x2mge75x-740j2mj5ig","date":"June 17, 2023","title":"Welcome to my blog!","author":"Chris","content":"Welcome to my blog! Please excuse any bugs. I'm still working those out!\n\nMy intent for this part of the site is to be able to blog from Europe while Vista and I hike <a href=\"http://www.johnhayeswalks.com/2014/09/munich-to-venice-dream-way-review.html\">Der Traumpfad</a>. But I'm still a bit skeptical that this will work. Guess we'll just have to see how it goes.\n\nOh! I should also mention, there won't be any images in the posts on this blog yet. I haven't had the time to get that part setup yet. But I'll hopefully have that ready by the time we leave for the trip.\n\n- Chris"}]}]
