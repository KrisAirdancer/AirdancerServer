It really does have a lot of bugs, but I'll iron those out eventually.\n\nMy intent for this thing is to be able to blog from Europe while Vista and I hike Der Traumpfad. But I'm still a bit skeptical that this will work. Guess we'll just have to see how it goes.\n\nOh! I should also mention, don't expect any images. I wasn't interested in taking the time to put that part of this blog together. Sorry, not sorry."
