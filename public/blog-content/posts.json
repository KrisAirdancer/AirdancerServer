I'm still working those out!\n\nMy intent for this part of the site is to be able to blog from Europe while Vista and I hike Der Traumpfad. But I'm still a bit skeptical that this will work. Guess we'll just have to see how it goes.\n\nOh! I should also mention, there won't be any images in the posts on this blog yet. I haven't had the time to get that part setup yet. But I'll hopefully have that ready by the time we leave for the trip.\n\n- Chris"
